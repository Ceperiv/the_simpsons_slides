            <h2>MEGGIE</h2>
            <p>Margaret Evelyn Lenny "Maggie" Simpson (born January 14, 1988) is the 1-year-old daughter and
                youngest child of Marge and Homer Simpson, the baby sister to Bart and Lisa Simpson and one of the five
                main characters of The Simpsons. She is often seen sucking on her pacifier, and when she walks, she
                trips over her clothing and falls on her face. Because she rarely ever talks, Maggie is the least seen
                and heard in the Simpson family. Maggie is at the very young, infant age of 1.</p>

            <h2>LISA</h2>
            <p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9, 1983) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and
                one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
                Lisa has yellow skin, blue eyes (although the pupils look like 2 black dots just like the other
                characters), and a blonde “starfish" hairstyle that is styled into points and matches the color of her
                skin. She doesn’t have any visible hairline. She’s usually seen wearing a short, strapless vermillion
                dress with a zigzag hem, matching orange Mary-Jane shoes, and a white pearl necklace (given to her by
                Marge). She’s 4'2" tall.

            <h2>BART</h2>
            <p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)is the mischievous, rebellious,
                misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The
                Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He
                also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the
                cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding".
                Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is
                loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.</p>

            <h2>MARGE</h2>
            <p>Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (née Bouvier) is the homemaker and matriarch of the Simpson
                family. She is also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. She and her husband Homer
                have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often
                provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the
                Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers
                ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.</p>

            <h2>HOMER</h2>
            <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956 or 1969 or 1975 or 1983) is a man from Springfield. He is the
                spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239
                pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown
                to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he
                doesn't.</p>
